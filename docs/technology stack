We decided to choose the following technology stack: 
- React for the front-end 
- Python for the back-end 
- AWS 



React:

- We decided to use react for the front-end due to the fact that it has a lot of added functionality and has a better front end display than just basic 
HTML and CSS. Furthermore, in our team, Carter and Favor have used it in the past and they mentioned the fact that VSCode would automatically give us a 
starred app when you run npm start making it easy to create a web app.


AWS:

- We decided to use AWS because it allows us to seamlessly connect an API to the Lambda backend. Lambda also lets us test out our backend on different JSON 
inputs and see statistics on how long invocations of the backend.


Python:

- We took the decision to use Python for the back-end because Django is effortless to use and reliable. In addition, codes in Python are very easy to 
understand with proper indentation and as the language resembles plain English. Consequently, we thought using Python would be the right choice especially 
when  working on a team project as we need to understand each other's code.
